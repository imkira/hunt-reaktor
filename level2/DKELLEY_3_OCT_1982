SUBJECT: Re: Clinical trials
DATE: 8 Oct 1982

Jeremy, Mikael,

just got green light from management. We're good to go for clinical trials. I
know you're both probably getting sick of me droning on about this, but
management told me to remind you once more of the strict confidentiality of
your research. We've had a couple of critical leaks in the last few years, and
we can't afford yet another case of Sutherland getting their vaccine out on
the market before us.

I know this is highly unorthodox, but the management wants you to play things
extra careful. They've selected a group of test subjects from inside the
company. These people have all signed waivers and will receive a commensurate
compensation of their efforts.

I have full confidence in you guys. Let's make history.
