SUBJECT: Weird P. carinii outbreak?
DATE: 7 Jun 1981

Jeremy,

did you see this? CDC's reporting of strange occurences of P. carinii pneumonia.
What's weird about it is these are all perfectly healthy male subjects... Daniel's
having me fly over next week, so looks like I'll be around for Sondra's birthday
after all. If you're lucky I might just bring you a present as well - Daniel says
they've got samples for us.

> Patient 1: A previously healthy 33-year-old man developed P. carinii
> pneumonia and oral mucosal candidiasis in March 1981 after a 2-month history
> of fever associated with elevated liver enzymes, leukopenia, and CMV viruria.
> The serum complement-fixation CMV titer in October 1980 was 256; in may 1981
> it was 32.* The patient's condition deteriorated despite courses of
> treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), pentamidine, and
> acyclovir. He died May 3, and postmortem examination showed residual P.
> carinii and CMV pneumonia, but no evidence of neoplasia.
> 
> Patient 2: A previously healthy 30-year-old man developed p. carinii
> pneumonia in April 1981 after a 5-month history of fever each day and of
> elevated liver-function tests, CMV viruria, and documented seroconversion to
> CMV, i.e., an acute-phase titer of 16 and a convalescent-phase titer of 28*
> in anticomplement immunofluorescence tests. Other features of his illness
> included leukopenia and mucosal candidiasis. His pneumonia responded to a
> course of intravenous TMP/.SMX, but, as of the latest reports, he continues
> to have a fever each day.
> 
> Patient 3: A 30-year-old man was well until January 1981 when he developed
> esophageal and oral candidiasis that responded to Amphotericin B treatment.
> He was hospitalized in February 1981 for P. carinii pneumonia that responded
> to TMP/SMX. His esophageal candidiasis recurred after the pneumonia was
> diagnosed, and he was again given Amphotericin B. The CMV complement-
> fixation titer in March 1981 was 8. Material from an esophageal biopsy was
> positive for CMV.
> 
> Patient 4: A 29-year-old man developed P. carinii pneumonia in February 1981.
> He had had Hodgkins disease 3 years earlier, but had been successfully
> treated with radiation therapy alone. He did not improve after being given
> intravenous TMP/SMX and corticosteroids and died in March. Postmortem
> examination showed no evidence of Hodgkins disease, but P. carinii and CMV
> were found in lung tissue.
> 
> Patient 5: A previously healthy 36-year-old man with clinically diagnosed
> CMV infection in September 1980 was seen in April 1981 because of a 4-month
> history of fever, dyspnea, and cough. On admission he was found to have P.
> carinii pneumonia, oral candidiasis, and CMV retinitis. A complement-
> fixation CMV titer in April 1981 was 128. The patient has been treated with
> 2 short courses of TMP/SMX that have been limited because of a sulfa-induced
> neutropenia. He is being treated for candidiasis with topical nystatin.
